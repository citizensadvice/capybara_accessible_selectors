- `:main`, `:banner` and `:contentinfo` selectors no longer requires the element to be a direct child of `<body>`

- `accessible_name` filter (Selenium only)
- `role` method to Node
  - A selenium driver will use the browser's computed role

  and will return "none" and "presentation" as `nil`

- `select_combo_box_option` takes a block which can be used to filter the found options

  - now also takes a boolean allowing you to check if a field is or isn't invalid
- `have_validation_errors`:
  - allows use of `within` and `within_fieldset` within the block
  - allows you to use `radio_group` to match multiple radios by a fieldset legend
  - added some missing selectors
  - corrected logic for finding invalid fields
- The `current` filter will now accept `nil` to match having no `aria-current` [Sean Doyle]
