# Capybara accessible selectors

A set of Capybara selectors that allow you to
find common UI elements by labels and using screen-reader compatible mark-up.

## Philosophy

All feature tests should interact with the browser in the same way a screen-reader user would.  This both tests the feature, and ensures the application is accessible.

To be accessible to a screen-reader, a page should be built from the native html elements with the semantics and behaviour required for each feature.  For example if the page contains a button it should use `<button>` element rather than adding a `onClick` handler to a `<span>`.

Where a feature does not exist in HTML, such as tabs, then ARIA roles and states can be used to convey the meaning to a screen-reader.

For a better overview see [Using aria](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/).

As a result all tests should be built from the visible labels on the page, and the semantic meaning of elements, and ARIA roles and attribute.

CSS and XPATH selectors based on classes, ids and nesting elements with no semantic meaning, should not be used.

This gem contains a set of selectors and filters for common UI elements and element states that are not already included in Capybara.  These selectors follow the guidelines in [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).

Examples:

```ruby
# Bad selectors
# - fragile and does not check the control is correctly labelled

page.find(:css, "#widget > div > .field").set("Bob")

fill_in "field_name_1", with: "Bob"

page.find(:css, "#tab_1").click

within(:css, "#tabs > div > div.panel:first-child") do
  expect(page).to have_text "Client name Bob"
end

# Good selectors
# - based on how a screen reader would hear and navigate a page

within_fieldset "User details" do
  fill_in "First name", with: "Bob"
end

select_tab "Client details"

expect(page).to have_tab_panel "Client details", text: "Client name Bob"

within_modal "Are you sure?" do
  click_button "OK"
end
```

## Usage

Include in your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem "capybara_accessible_selectors", git: "https://github.com/citizensadvice/capybara_accessible_selectors"
end
```

## Documentation

See the [Capybara cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/capybara) for an overview of built-in Capybara selectors and actions.

### Filters

#### `described_by` [String]

Added to: `field`, `fillable_field`, `datalist_input`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box` and `rich_text`.

Is the field described by some text using [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute).

For example:

```html
<label>
	My field
	<input aria-describedby="id1 id2" />
</label>
<span id="id1">My</span>
<span id="id2">description</span>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_field "My field", described_by: "My description"
```

#### `fieldset` [String, Symbol, Array]

Added to: `button`, `link`, `link_or_button`, `field`, `fillable_field`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box` and `rich_text`.

Filter for controls within a `<fieldset>` by `<legend>` text.  This can also take an array of fieldsets for multiple nested fieldsets.

For example:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>My question</legend>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 1
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 2
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

```ruby
find :radio_button, "Answer 1", fieldset: "My question"
choose "Answer 1", fieldset: "My question"
```

Also see [↓ Locating fields](#locating-fields)

#### `focused` [Boolean]

Added to all selectors.

Filters for an element that currently has focus.

```html
<label>My field <input /></label>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_field "My field", focused: true
```

#### `validation_error` [String]

Added to: `field`, `fillable_field`, `datalist_input`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box` and `rich_text`.

Filters for an element being both invalid, and has a description or label containing the error message.

To be invalid, the element must [`willValidate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLObjectElement/willValidate) and have a [`validity.valid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) that is false.  Additionally the `aria-invalid` must not contradict the validity state.

For the error description, this can be contained in the ARIA description, or the label.

```html
<label>
	My field
	<input required aria-describedby="error-id" />
</label>
<span id="error-id">This is required</span>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_field "My field", validation_error: "This is required"
```

- [↓ `have_no_validation_errors` expecation](#have_no_validation_errors)

### Selectors

#### Locating fields

The following selectors have been extended so you can use an array as the locator to select within a fieldset.  The last element of the array is the field label, and the other elements are fieldsets.

Extended selectors: `button`, `link`, `link_or_button`, `field`, `fillable_field`, `datalist_input`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box`, `rich_text`.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>My question</legend>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 1
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 2
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

```ruby
find :radio_button, ["My question", "Answer 1"]
choose ["My question", "Answer 1"]
```

Also see [↑ `fieldset` filter](#fieldset-string-symbol-array)

#### `alert`

Selects an element with the role of [`alert`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#alert).

```html
<div role="alert">Important message</div>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :alert, text: "Successfully saved"
expect(page).to have_alert, text: "Successfully saved"
```

Also see [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

#### `combo_box`

Finds a [combo box](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox).
This will find ARIA 1.0 and ARIA 1.1 combo boxes.  A combo box is an input with a popup list of options. 

This also finds select based on [Twitter typeahead](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) classes, but this behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Locator and options are the same as the [field selector](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/Capybara/Selector).

Note that the built-in Capybara selector `datalist_input` will find a [native html `list` attribute based combo-box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist).

Also see:

- [↓ `select_combo_box_option` action](#select_combo_box_optionwith-options)
- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

#### `disclosure`

Finds a [disclosure](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#disclosure).  This will find both a [native disclosure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) (`<details>`/`<summary>`) and an ARIA disclosure.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The text label of the disclosure
- Filters:
  - `expanded` [Boolean] Is the disclosure expanded

Note that an ARIA disclosure is typically hidden when closed.  Using `expanded: false` will only find an element where `visible:` is set to `false` or `:all`.

Also see:

- [↓ `toggle_disclosure` action](#toggle_disclosurename-expand)
- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)
- [↓ `within_disclosure`](#within_disclosurename-find_options-block)

#### `disclosure_button`

Finds the open and close button associated with a [disclosure](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#disclosure).  This will be a `<summary>`, a `<button>` or an element with the role of button.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The text label of the disclosure
- Filters:
  - `expanded` [Boolean] Is the disclosure expanded

Also see:

- [↓ `toggle_disclosure` action](#toggle_disclosurename-expand)
- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

#### `item`

Finds a [microdata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Microdata) item.

Microdata isn't exposed to users, including screen-readers.  However this can still be a useful way to check a page has the expected information in the expected place.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The `itemprop` name of the item
- Filters:
  - `type` [String, Symbol, Array] The `itemtype`.  Also accepts and array of itemtypes.

Example:

```html
<dl itemscope itemtype="application:person">
  <dt>First name</dt>
  <dd itemprop="first-name">Bob</dd>
  <dt>Last name</dt>
  <dd itemprop="last-name">Hoskins</dd>
</dl>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :item, "first-name", type: "application:person", text: "Bob"
```

Also see [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

#### `modal`

Finds a [modal dialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_modal).

This checks for a modal with the correct aria role, `aria-modal="true"` attribute, and it has an associated title.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The title of the modal

Also see:

- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)
- [↓ `within_modal`](#within_modalname-find_options-block)

#### `rich_text`

Finds a rich text editor.

This should be compatible with most browser based rich text editors.  It searches for `contenteditable` section marked up with the correct role.  It is also compatible with `<iframe>` based editors such as CKEditor 4 and TinyMCE.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The label for the editor.  This can be an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.  For iframe editors this is the `title` attribute.

For testing the content of an iframe based editor you need to use `within_frame`, or you can use `within_rich_text`.

```ruby
# non-iframe based editors
expect(page).to have_selector :rich_text, "Label", text: "My content"

# iframe based editors
within_frame find(:rich_text, "Label") do
  expect(page).to have_text "My content"
end
```

- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)
- [↓ `within_rich_text`](#within_rich_textname-find_options-block)

#### `section`

Finds a section of the site based on the first heading in the section.

A section is html sectioning element: `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<main>` or `<form>`.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The text of the first heading
- filters:
  - `heading_level` [Integer, Enumerable] The heading level to find.  Defaults to `(1..6)`
  - `section_element` [String, Symbol, Array] The section element to use.  Defaults to `%i[section article aside footer header main form]`

```html
<section>
  <div>
    <h2>My section</h2>
  </div>
  Some content
</section>
```

```ruby
within :section, "My section" do
	expect(page).to have_text "Some content"
end
```

- [↓ `within_section`](#within_sectionname-find_options-block)

#### `tab_panel`

Finds a [tab panel](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel).

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The text label of the tab button associated with the panel
- Filters:
  - `open` [Boolean] Is the tab panel open.

Note that a closed tab panel is not visible.  Using `open: false` will only find an element where `visible:` is set to `false` or `:all`.

within_disclosure "Client details" do
  expect(page).to have_text "Name: Frank"
end
```

Also see [↑ `disclosure` selector](#disclosure)

#### `within_modal(name, **find_options, &block)`

Execute the block within a modal.

```ruby
within_modal "Are you sure?" do
  click_button "Confirm"
end
```

Also see [↑ `modal` selector](#modal)

#### `within_rich_text(name, **find_options, &block)`

Execute within the rich text.  If the rich text is iframe based this will execute "`within_frame`".

```ruby
within_rich_text "Journal entry" do

### Expectations

#### `have_validation_errors(&block)`

Checks if a page has a set of validation errors.  This will fail if the page does not have the exact set of errors.

- `&block` - this takes a block.  In the block each validation error expection should be added using the following DSL:

```ruby
expect(page).to have_validation_errors do
  field "Name", validation_error: "This is required"
  select "Gender", validation_error: "This is required"
  field "Age", validation_error: "Please choose a number less than 120"
  
  # The block methods correspond to the following selectors:
  # field, radio_button, checkbox, select, file_field and combo_box
end
```

Also see [↑ `validation_error` filter](#validation_error-string)

#### `have_no_validation_errors`

Checks if a page has no invalid fields.

```ruby
expect(page).to have_no_validation_errors
``` 
  
Also see [↑ `validation_error` filter](#validation_error-string)  
  
#### Expectation shortcuts

The following expectation shortcuts are also added for both "have\__selector_" and "have\_no\__selector_":

- `have_alert`
- `have_combo_box`
- `have_disclosure`
- `have_disclosure_button`
- `have_item`
- `have_modal`
- `have_section`
- `have_tab_panel`
- `have_tab_button`

For example the following two are equivalent:

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :combo_box, "Foo"
expect(page).to have_combo_box, "Foo"

```
