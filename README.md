# Capybara accessible selectors

A set of Capybara selectors that allow you to
find common UI elements by labels and using screen-reader compatible mark-up.

[Cheat sheet](CHEAT_SHEET.md)

## Philosophy

All feature tests should interact with the browser in the same way a screen-reader user would. This both tests the feature, and ensures the application is accessible.

To be accessible to a screen-reader, a page should be built from the native html elements with the semantics and behaviour required for each feature. For example if the page contains a button it should use `<button>` element rather than adding a `onClick` handler to a `<span>`.

Where a feature does not exist in HTML, such as tabs, then ARIA roles and states can be used to convey the meaning to a screen-reader.

For a better overview see [Using aria](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/).

As a result all tests should be built from the visible labels on the page, and the semantic meaning of elements, and ARIA roles and attribute.

CSS and XPATH selectors based on classes, ids and nesting elements with no semantic meaning, should not be used.

This gem contains a set of selectors and filters for common UI elements and element states that are not already included in Capybara. These selectors follow the guidelines in [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).

Examples:

```ruby
# Bad selectors
# - fragile and does not check the control is correctly labelled

page.find(:css, "#widget > div > .field").set("Bob")

fill_in "field_name_1", with: "Bob"

page.find(:css, "#tab_1").click

within(:css, "#tabs > div > div.panel:first-child") do
  expect(page).to have_text "Client name Bob"
end

# Good selectors
# - based on how a screen reader would hear and navigate a page

within_fieldset "User details" do
  fill_in "First name", with: "Bob"
end

select_tab "Client details"

expect(page).to have_tab_panel "Client details", text: "Client name Bob"

within_modal "Are you sure?" do
  click_button "OK"
end
```

## Usage

Include in your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem "capybara_accessible_selectors", git: "https://github.com/citizensadvice/capybara_accessible_selectors", branch: "main"
end
```

## Documentation

See the [Capybara cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/capybara) for an overview of built-in Capybara selectors and actions.

### Filters

#### `accessible_name` [String, Regexp]

Added to all selectors.

Currently only supported for Selenium drivers.

Filters for an element's computed accessible name. A string will do a partial match, unless the `exact` option is set.

This uses the Selenium driver `accessible_name` method which uses the accessible name calculated by the browser. Support
is reasonably good in modern browsers for common use cases, but browsers do not produce the same results for
all cases and some screen-readers will perform their own calculations.

This method must request the accessible name from the driver for each node found by the selector individually.
Therefore, using this with a selector that returns a large number of elements will be inefficient.

```html
<button id="id1" aria-labelledby="id1 id2">Delete</button>
<a id="id2" href="./files/Documentation.pdf">Documentation.pdf</a>
```

```ruby
click_button accessible_name: "Delete Documentation.pdf"
```

#### `aria` [Hash]

Added to: `button`, `checkbox`, `css`, `element`, `field`, `file_field`, `fillable_field`, `link`, `link_or_button`, `radio_button`, `select`, and `xpath`

Filters for an element that declares [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#introstates)

```html
<button aria-controls="some-state" aria-pressed="true">A pressed button</button>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :button, "A pressed button", aria: { controls: "some-state", pressed: true }
```

#### `current` [String, Symbol]

Added to: `link`, `link_or_button`.

Is the element the current item within a container or set of related elements using [`aria-current`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-current).

For example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/about-us" aria-current="page">About us</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_link "Home", current: nil
expect(page).to have_link "About us", current: "page"
```

**Note:** The `[aria-current]` attribute supports both `"true"` and `"false"`
values. A `current: true` will match against `[aria-current="true"]`, and a
`current: false` will match against `[aria-current="false"]`. To match an
element **without any** `[aria-current]` attribute, pass `current: nil`.

#### `described_by` [String, Regexp]

Added to all selectors.

Is the field described by some text using [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute).

For example:

```html
<label>
  My field
  <input aria-describedby="id1 id2" />
</label>
<span id="id1">My</span>
<span id="id2">description</span>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_field "My field", described_by: "My description"
```

#### `fieldset` [String, Symbol, Array]

Added to: `button`, `link`, `link_or_button`, `field`, `fillable_field`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box` and `rich_text`.

Filter for controls within a `<fieldset>` by `<legend>` text. This can also take an array of fieldsets for multiple nested fieldsets.

For example:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>My question</legend>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 1
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 2
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

```ruby
find :radio_button, "Answer 1", fieldset: "My question"
choose "Answer 1", fieldset: "My question"
```

Also see [↓ Locating fields](#locating-fields)

#### `required` [Boolean]

Added to: `button`, `link`, `link_or_button`, `field`, `fillable_field`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box` and `rich_text`.

Filter for controls with a `required` or `aria-required` attribute.

For example:

```html
<label>
  <input requied />
  Text
</label>
```

```ruby
find :field, required: true
```

#### `role` [String, Symbol, nil]

Added to all selectors

Filters for an element with a matching calculated [role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#introroles), or with no role if `nil` is supplied.

The roles "none", "presentation" and "generic" are returned as `nil` as they are implementation details not
exposed to users.

This uses the Selenium driver `aria_role` method which uses the role calculated by the browser taking
into account [implicit role mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/). The results for implicit roles are
not consistent across all browsers, but are good for more common use cases.

Rack test will currently only use the value of the `role` attribute and does not return implicit role values.

This method must request the role from the driver for each node found by the selector individually.
Therefore, using this with a selector that returns a large number of elements will be inefficient.

```html
<label for="switch-input">A switch input</label>
<input id="switch-input" type="checkbox" role="switch" />
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_field "A switch input", role: "switch"
```

#### `validation_error` [String, Regexp, true, false]

Added to: `field`, `fillable_field`, `datalist_input`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box` and `rich_text`.

Filters for an element being both invalid, and has a description or label containing the error message.

This differs from the Capybara `valid` and `validation_message` filters which only consider the HTML validation API.

To be invalid, the element must

- Not have [`willValidate === false`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLObjectElement/willValidate)
- Have [`validity.valid === false`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) **or** or have `aria-invalid="true"`
- Not have the `validity.valid === false` and `aria-invalid="false"

For the error description, this can be contained in the accessible description, or the accessible name.

```html
<label>
  My field
  <input required aria-describedby="error-id" />
</label>
<span id="error-id">This is required</span>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_field "My field", validation_error: "This is required"

# Just check the field is invalid
expect(page).to have_field "My field", validation_error: true

# Just check the field is not invalid
expect(page).to have_field "My field", validation_error: false
```

### Selectors

#### Locating fields

The following selectors have been extended so you can use an array as the locator to select within a fieldset. The last element of the array is the field label, and the other elements are fieldsets.

Extended selectors: `button`, `link`, `link_or_button`, `field`, `fillable_field`, `datalist_input`, `radio_button`, `checkbox`, `select`, `file_field`, `combo_box`, `rich_text`.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>My question</legend>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 1
  </label>
  <label>
    <input type="radio" name="radios" />
    Answer 2
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

```ruby
find :radio_button, ["My question", "Answer 1"]
choose ["My question", "Answer 1"]
```

Also see [↑ `fieldset` filter](#fieldset-string-symbol-array)

#### `alert`

Selects an element with the role of [`alert`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/).

```html
<div role="alert">Important message</div>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :alert, text: "Successfully saved"
expect(page).to have_alert, text: "Successfully saved"
```

Also see [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

#### `article`

Finds an [article structural role](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/structural-roles/#all-structural-roles). The selector will match either an [`<article>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) or an element with [role="article"](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#article).

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The article's `[aria-label]` attribute or contents
  of the element referenced by its `[aria-labelledby]` attribute

Also see:

- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

Finds a [banner landmark](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/landmark-regions/#x4-3-1-banner).

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The landmark's `[aria-label]` attribute or contents
  of the element referenced by its `[aria-labelledby]` attribute

Also see:

- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

#### `columnheader`

Finds a [columnheader](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#columnheader) cell that's either a `<th>` element descendant of a `<table>`, or a `[role="columnheader"]` element.

- `locator` [String, Symbol] The text contents of the element
- filters:
  - `colindex` [Integer, String] Filters elements based on their position amongst their siblings, or elements with a matching [aria-colindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-colindex)

- [↓ Expectation shortcuts](#expectation-shortcuts)

Example:

```html
<table role="grid">
  <tr>
    <th>A columnheader</th>
  </tr>
</table>

<div role="grid">
  <div role="row">
    <div role="columnheader">A columnheader</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :columnheader, "A columnheader", count: 2
```

#### `combo_box`

Finds a [combo box](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/).
This will find ARIA 1.0 and ARIA 1.1 combo boxes. A combo box is an input with a popup list of options.

This also finds select based on [Twitter typeahead](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) classes, but this behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Locator and options are the same as the [field selector](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/Capybara/Selector) with the following additional filters:

- Filters:
  - `expanded` [Boolean] - Is the combo box expanded
  - `options` [Array\<String, Regexp\>] - Has exactly these options in order. This, and other other filters, will match if the option includes the string
  - `with_options` [Array\<String, Regexp\>] - Includes these options
  - `enabled_options` [Array\<String, Regexp\>] - Has exactly these enabled options in order
  - `with_enabled_options` [Array\<String, Regexp\>] - Includes these enabled options
  - `disabled_options` [Array\<String, Regexp\>] - Has exactly these disabled options in order
  - `with_disabled_options` [Array\<String, Regexp\>] - Includes these disabled options

Option text is normalised to single white spaces.

Note that the built-in Capybara selector `datalist_input` will find a [native html `list` attribute based combo-box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist).

### Expectations

#### `have_validation_errors(&block)`

Checks if a page has a set of validation errors.

This will compare all the validation errors on a page with an expected set of errors.
If the errors do not match it will not pass.

- `&block` - this takes a block. In the block each validation error exception should be added using the following DSL:

```ruby
expect(page).to have_validation_errors do
  field "Name", validation_error: "This is required"
  select "Gender", validation_error: "This is required"
  field "Age", validation_error: "Choose a number less than 120"
  radio_group "Radio questions", validation_error: "Select an option"

  # You can use all the field selectors in the block
  # checkbox datalist_input field file_field fillable_field radio_button select combo_box rich_text

  # Additionally a "radio_group" selector will find all radios in a fieldset
  # You can also use "within" and "within_fieldset" methods
end
```

Also see [↑ `validation_error` filter](#validation_error-string)

#### `have_no_validation_errors`

Checks if a page has no invalid fields.

```ruby
expect(page).to have_no_validation_errors
```

Also see [↑ `validation_error` filter](#validation_error-string)

#### Expectation shortcuts

The following expectation shortcuts are also added for both `have_selector_` and `have_no_selector_`:

- `have_alert`
- `have_article`
- `have_banner`
- `have_columnheader`
- `have_combo_box`
- `have_contentinfo`
- `have_disclosure`
- `have_disclosure_button`
- `have_grid`
- `have_gridcell`
- `have_heading`
- `have_item`
- `have_main`
- `have_modal`
- `have_navigation`
- `have_region`
- `have_row`
- `have_section`
- `have_tab_panel`
- `have_tab_button`

For example the following two are equivalent:

```ruby
expect(page).to have_selector :combo_box, "Foo"
expect(page).to have_combo_box, "Foo"
```
